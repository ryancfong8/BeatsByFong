## Beats By Fong

### Background

Beats By Fong is an interactive dynamic musical web app that responds to the user's keystrokes with sounds and animations. Each key is linked to a musical sound and animations will be generated each time the key is pressed. The animations will be an audio visualization of the sounds generated.  Users can play a demo track that will allow the full audio visualization effect to be displayed.

### Functionality & MVP

With the Beats By Fong musical web app, users will be able to:

- [ ] Hear a different musical instrument each time a key is pressed
- [ ] Automatically generate an animation based on each keystroke
- [ ] Audio visualization based on the sound frequencies generated

In addition, this project will include:

- [ ] A production ReadMe

### Wireframes

This app will consist of a single screen where the name will be in the top-center and instructions will be under it.  The animations will be generated under the name, and continuous audio will result in continuous animation (an audio visualization).

### Architecture and technologies

- Vanilla Javascript and `jquery` for overall structure
- `Howler.js` for sounds
- Web Audio API to get audio information
- `Anime.js` for animation
- `D3.js` or `Easel.js` for DOM manipulation and rendering, with the possibility of `three.js` for 3D animations

In addition to the webpack entry file, there will be multiple scripts involved in this project:

`animations.js`: this script will handle the necessary logic for animations.

`keycodes-sounds.js`: this script will handle which sounds line up to each key code.

`audio-visualizer.js`: this script will handle the audio visualization logic.  Audio data will be received and manipulated using mathematical equations to render animations.

### Implementation Timeline

**Day 1** Become familiar with all libraries. Create `webpack.config.js` as well as `package.json`. Write a basic entry file and the bare bones of all of the scripts. Goals for day:

- Get a bundle with `webpack`
- Learn enough `d3.js` to render an object
- Setup keycodes and sounds

**Day 2** Learn the audio visualization logic.  Grab data from a song file and see what data I can manipulate. Understand and determine which animation I can render based on the data I receive. Goals for the day:

- Finish keycodes and sounds
- Draw necessary items for animations
- Work on animations, examine audio data

**Day 3** Create animations. Sync animations to music. Goals for the day:

- Get one working animation with keystrokes
- Get the animation synced with the audio wave generated by the sound

**Day 4** Incorporate a demo track and test animation. Have audio generated by keystrokes generate animations as well. Goals for the day:

- Finish project by implementing a demo track.  
- Ensure animations are working properly.

### Bonus features

Some anticipated bonus features (or alternative features to audio visualizaion) are:

- [ ] Add the ability to save songs
- [ ] Add the ability to change the instrument with a different set of sounds for the keyboard
- [ ] Add multiple different animations for audio visualization
